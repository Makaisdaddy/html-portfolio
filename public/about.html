<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello every body and welcome to my page. My name is Maury Werth, born and raised in Savannah Ga. A small town on the coast of Georgia but also the oldest 
  city in Georgia. I was born 1981, before the internet or google !I actually remember the internet coming into the world, dealing with the extreme lag time of dial up, 
  and also the pure enjoyment of going online for the first time! I also remember the old floppy disk that we used and remember playing the oregon trail on an
  old dos computer! Talking about  speed of the internet now to then, there was none! you could make dinner in the time you could even sign on when it was
  flooded with other people trying to access the internet at the same time. we didn't have affordable cellphones until mid to late 90's and our rule was go
  outside and be home before the street lights come on. we were the last generation to live most of our childhood playing outside almost all of the time.
  I was always outside building ramps to jump my bikes off of, or ramps to jump off when i was on my roller blades! we would build tree forts in the woods 
  around where I lived,we had access to docks to swim and fish in the rivers and i found my love for boats, fishing, and swimming.  I grew up in a part of 
  Savannah that is Called Isle of Hope. I was born and raised there by both parents until they got divorced. My father finally bought a place on  Wilmington 
  Island, still considered Savannah Ga. My mother was registered nurse at the local hospital and also a Lt. Colonel in the Airforce. My father was a business 
  owner of a rural water system that supplied water to residential and some commercial properties. He also found a passion for playing with computers and 
  trying different software that came out and games we could play on the computer together.   </p>

<p>My father finding interest in computers is also what inspired me to learn more and get experience with computers. I remember trying to help my dad change out memory
  sticks and replace hard drives. I also remember him trying to build a custom pc in the early 90's, it was not a successful venture! through out this time between being 
  outside to play almost all the time, and trying to navigate life, I ended up working for my fathers water company, then moved into HVAC/R(heating Venting Air Conditioning
  and Refrigeration). I had two daughters between the time of 19 to 23, Now I have 5 daughters and one boy! I always wanted to go into IT but never could find the time. Between working, being a father, and my 
  training at the boxing gym took all of my time. later i transitioned to training MMA and tried to pursue a career in fighting. I followed my passion for the water, sold 
  my houses and bought a sailboat. Hurricane Dorian crashed my first boat, then i bought a catermaran sail boat and sailed it singlehandedly around Florida with my pup, Nestlee! 
  This is when I realized that I should really start to rethink my career choice and truly pursue my dream of working in IT. If i could sail a boat single-handely around Florida
  I could conquer anything i wanted to do! I knew I wanted to learn software engineering or something similar. I was always interested in what people referred to as hacking, as 
  well as developing and web design. It was really scary at first trying to navigate through all of the information out there. Believe it or not, there actually is a lot of bad 
  information, including from Universities that claim to have inside help to get you into IT fast! I was secure in my position doing HVAC/R and didn't want to take the risk of starting 
  a new career. i was generally scared to do something different. That didn't stop me from learning on my own little by little, which eventually lead me to where im at now, taking 
  some individual classes on web design and programming languages. I did take a few classes at Ashford online University but life, work, and my kids took a bigger precedent in my life
  and had to drop out of school, Me being determined and hard headed to not give up has pushed me to pursue this new career on my own through self study. So far ive completed an ethical
  hacking course from David Bombel, learned some really cool things, and now taking a web design class from Angela Wu. So far this class has been awesome and i love the content! I can 
  definitely see my self changing careers soon. 
</p>

<p>Out of all the things I have learned in this life, the computer classes, the ethical hacking course, the web design classes have been the most interesting to me. Just like HVAC,
   web design requires patience, skill, critical thinking, analytical thinking, attention to detail, and determination. there are a lot of other things required also, but those are 
   among the most important to me. i truly look forward to bringing my work ethic into the IT field and being the next productive member in the field that can help it grow and i look 
   forward to the changes and hard work it takes to get there! Hard work, determination, drive, dedication, and the will to never give up is what has made me successful so far. I look 
  to the failures that will come, because the failures make the best teachers! </p>
